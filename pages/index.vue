          p For my dissertation, I am examining how Central American immigrant families in the San Francisco Bay Area describe, understand, and cope with experiences of violence, and how their experiences shape and are shaped by their family relationships across generations. In conducting my qualitative study, I hope to investigate violence materially, through studying when and how interpersonal violence occurs, as well as discursively, by exploring how violence is constructed. Through the use of in-depth interviews and ethnographic observations, I will apply grounded theory analysis to immigrant family experiences of violence and trauma.
